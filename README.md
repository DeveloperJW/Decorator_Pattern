# Decorator_Pattern
OOP- Project 4 -Decorator Pattern

Decorator pattern allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of
other objects from the same class.

- This is achieved by designing a new decorator class that wraps the original class.
